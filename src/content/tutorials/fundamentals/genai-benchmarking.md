In this tutorial, we will walk you through benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) on your Jetson. This is meant to be a more general benchmarking guide that helps you understand the workflow and the main metrics.

We will begin by serving the model with a simple setup, then capture and analyze the most critical metrics from our benchmark.

## What We're Measuring (and What We're Not)

In this tutorial, we are measuring the **performance** of the model, not its quality. Our goal is to answer questions like:

- How fast is it? (Latency)
- How much work can it handle at once? (Throughput)

We will **not** be evaluating the model's accuracy or how "smart" its answers are. We'll focus on these three key metrics:

### Time to First Token (TTFT)

How long a user has to wait before the model starts generating a response. This is crucial for a responsive user experience. The initial delay before the first token appears exists because the model must first process your entire input prompt (a step called 'prefill') to compute its internal state, known as the KV cache. This upfront work is what allows vLLM to generate all subsequent tokens extremely fast.

### Output Token Throughput (tok/s)

The total number of tokens the model can generate per second across all concurrent requests. This is our main measure of overall server capacity.

### Inter-Token Latency (ITL)

The average delay between each token generated in the response. This affects how smoothly the text appears to "stream" to the user.

---

## Real-World Example

Imagine a drone using an onboard VLM to detect fires from its camera feed. The model is constantly processing this feed with the prompt, "Do you see a fire?" and is connected to an alert system.

In this scenario:
- A **low TTFT** is critical, as it's the time from the camera seeing fire to the system generating the first word of an alert like "Yes..."
- The **Output Token Throughput** then determines how quickly the model can provide a full, detailed description like "...a large fire is spreading in the north quadrant."

## 1. Preparing Your Jetson Environment

First, before starting the benchmark, we recommend you reboot the unit to make sure we are starting from a clean state. We also recommend setting your Jetson to **MAXN mode**:

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 0
```

### Get the vLLM Container

We will use a pre-built Docker container published by NVIDIA that has vLLM and all its dependencies. This guarantees a consistent environment for reproducible results and saves us from the complex process of building vLLM from source.

**Jetson Orin**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nvidia-ai-iot/vllm:latest-jetson-orin
```

**Jetson Thor**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nvidia-ai-iot/vllm:latest-jetson-thor
```

---

## 2. The Benchmarking Workflow

The benchmarking process requires two separate terminals because we need one to serve the model and another to send benchmark requests to it.

### Step 1: Open Two Terminals

Open two terminal windows on your Jetson:
- **Terminal 1** (Serving Terminal)
- **Terminal 2** (Benchmark Terminal)

### Step 2: Launch the Container

In **Terminal 1**, start and enter the container:

**Jetson Orin**

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it --network host --shm-size=16g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --runtime=nvidia --name=vllm -v $HOME/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface ghcr.io/nvidia-ai-iot/vllm:latest-jetson-orin
```

**Jetson Thor**

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it --network host --shm-size=16g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --runtime=nvidia --name=vllm -v $HOME/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface ghcr.io/nvidia-ai-iot/vllm:latest-jetson-thor
```

In **Terminal 2**, access the same running container:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it vllm bash
```

You should now have two terminals, both inside the same running Docker container.

### Step 3: Serve the Model (Terminal 1)

In your Serving Terminal, run the following command to load the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B quantized model:

```bash
vllm serve "RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16" \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.8
```

**What this argument means:**

- `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.8`: Lets vLLM use about 80% of available GPU memory for serving. This is a simple and practical starting point for benchmarking.

Wait until you see:

```text
(APIServer pid=92) INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
(APIServer pid=92) INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Leave this terminal running.

### Step 4: Warm Up the Model (Terminal 2)

Before the real benchmark, perform a "warm-up" to populate vLLM's internal caches:

```bash
vllm bench serve \
  --dataset-name random \
  --model RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16 \
  --num-prompts 50 \
  --percentile-metrics ttft,tpot,itl,e2el \
  --random-input-len 2048 \
  --random-output-len 128 \
  --max-concurrency 1
```

> **Ignore the results from this run.**

**Note on Dataset Choice:** For synthetic runs, we use `--dataset-name random` to fix token counts precisely. For VLM benchmarks, use a dataset with images like `lmarena-ai/vision-arena-bench-v0.1`:

```bash
vllm bench serve \
  --dataset-name hf \
  --dataset-path lmarena-ai/vision-arena-bench-v0.1 \
  --hf-split train \
  --model <your_vlm_model> \
  --num-prompts 50 \
  --percentile-metrics ttft,tpot,itl,e2el \
  --hf-output-len 128 \
  --max-concurrency 1
```

### Step 5: Run the Official Benchmark (Terminal 2)

**Benchmark 1: Single-User Performance (Concurrency = 1)**

This test measures the best-case scenario for an individual user:

```bash
vllm bench serve \
  --dataset-name random \
  --model RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16 \
  --num-prompts 50 \
  --percentile-metrics ttft,tpot,itl,e2el \
  --random-input-len 2048 \
  --random-output-len 128 \
  --max-concurrency 1
```

**Benchmark 2: Multi-User Performance (Concurrency = 8)**

This test simulates 8 users sending requests simultaneously:

```bash
vllm bench serve \
  --dataset-name random \
  --model RedHatAI/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16 \
  --num-prompts 50 \
  --percentile-metrics ttft,tpot,itl,e2el \
  --random-input-len 2048 \
  --random-output-len 128 \
  --max-concurrency 8
```

## 3. Analyzing Your Results

### Key Metrics Explained

**Output token throughput (tok/s): 44.19**

vLLM measures this like:

```text
total generated tokens / total benchmark time
```

Keep in mind this is not just the generation time by itself. It also has the **TTFT** integrated into it, so it is better to think of this as a practical serving metric rather than a pure decode-only speed number.

**Mean TTFT (ms): 32.02**

This is the average initial wait time before a response begins generating. An extremely low result of just 32.02 milliseconds means the application will feel instantaneous and highly responsive.

> For VLMs, this number would usually be higher since we're dealing with images in addition to text.

**Mean ITL (ms): 22.47**

This measures the average time gap between each generated token after the first one. A low value of 22.47 milliseconds translates directly to a fast and smooth streaming experience.

## Concurrency 1 vs. 8: The Trade-Off

When you compare your results, you'll likely see a trade-off:

- Going from concurrency 1 to 8, the **Output Token Throughput should increase** significantly. The system is doing more total work.
- However, the **Mean TTFT and Mean ITL will also likely increase**. Since the Jetson is now splitting its time between 8 requests instead of 1, each individual request takes longer to process.

This is the classic trade-off between **overall capacity** and **individual user experience**. Your benchmark results help you find the right balance for your application.

> **Note:** The term "user" in this tutorial could mean the entity which consumes the output of the model — which could be a robotic application using the model in a drone, a humanoid, or simply you using it as a local LLM inference hardware.
